In the SQL challenge, I applied SQL techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, different join types (inner, outer, self, left, right, cross), string manipulation functions, window functions (including lag, lead, unbounded preceding, rank, row_number), combinatorial math, date functions, statistical summarization, dataset exploration, preprocessing, optimization, and analysis across various sectors to address business questions.
